Project Title: Design and Development of a Dual Alarm System for Home Security: Protecting Door and Yard Access

STAGE 1: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
In modern society, securing homes from unauthorized access is crucial. With increasing incidents of theft, it’s important to find efficient ways to deter intruders. Traditional alarm systems often produce false alarms, especially when they’re set off by non-threatening movements or triggers during the day. This project aims to design a dual-alarm system, where one alarm button is placed at the door and another in the yard. The alarm system will only be activated when a door is opened or when someone steps in the yard. The system will also feature switch based mechanism to activate the alarm at a set time each evening (e.g., at 6 p.m.) to minimize any unnecessary activation during the day when everyone is outside.

STATEMENT OF INTENT:
I intend to develop an alarm system that ensures only relevant movements such as someone opening the door or stepping into the yard trigger the alarm, while minimizing false alarms. This helps to hear and determine if there is an intruder.

STAGE 4: DEVELOPMENT OF IDEAS

The ideas from Stage 3 were then developed into a detailed design for the alarm system:

1. Component Selection:
Batteries: To power the alarm system 
Alarm inside house: Activates when the door is opened
Alarm at the yard: Activates when the yard mat is stepped 
An alarm yard button: to activate the alarm when stepped 
Door alarm button: For detecting door movement.
Alarm system: For the actual alert.
Button Switch: Activation of the system at 6 p.m.

2. System Design:
Circuit Design: Connecting the button and microcontroller to work in conjunction with each other. The door button will trigger the alarm when the door is opened, and the yard mat button will trigger the alarm if there’s foot traffic in the yard.
Timing Mechanism: A alarm switch will be used to turn the system on at 6 p.m. each day and off at 6 a.m.

3. Testing:
Testing the Door Button: We will test the reliability of the magnetic reed switch. Opening the door should reliably activate the alarm.
Testing the Yard Button: The button under the mat will be tested by simulating foot traffic to ensure the alarm is triggered only when someone steps on it 

STAGE 5: PRESENTATION OF RESULTS

Once the system was designed and tested, the findings were presented as follows:
Button Performance: Both the door sensor and yard sensor functioned as expected, with minimal risk of false alarms.
System Reliability: The switch activation ensured that the system was active only when necessary, reducing the chance of unnecessary alerts.
User Feedback: Feedback from users indicated that the system effectively detected intruders while minimizing the chances of false alarms.

The system was designed to ensure security while being cost-effective and easy to use. Detailed schematics and a step-by-step guide to building and programming the system were included in the final presentation.

SUB STAGE 1: DESIGN OF THE HOUSE MODEL

1. Objective:
To build a scaled model of a house that demonstrates the placement of the alarm buttons at key points, specifically the door and yard, and the workings of the dual-alarm system.

2. Materials:
Cardboard, plastic, or any suitable materials for constructing a scaled-down house model.
Sound-producing mechanisms to represent the activation of alarms.
Paper or printed components to represent the door and yard areas.
Connecting wires for the alarm systems.
Small motion sensors or similar devices (can be mocked up if actual sensors are unavailable).
   


SUB STAGE 2: THEORETICAL PRESENTATION OF RESULTS

1. Objective:
To analyse the expected performance of the dual-alarm system based on the theoretical calculations made earlier. This includes evaluating the effectiveness, the probability of false alarms, and the expected outcomes when sensors are activated.

2. System Activation:
Door Button: The door button is triggered when it detects any unauthorized attempt to open the door. 
Yard Sensor: The yard sensor detects movement in the yard area. If someone steps within the designated boundary, the sensor will activate.

3. Analysis of System’s Effectiveness:
The system is designed to reduce the number of false alarms by being active only when needed. The system will activate when it is turned on at 6 PM each day to ensure the house is secured when everyone is inside, and the sensors are on.

SUBS STAGE 4: VISUAL PRESENTATION (THE MODEL OF THE PROJECT)

1. Objective:
   - To visually represent the layout and functionality of the alarm system, both through the house model and through pictures
